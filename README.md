What is a poolable yarn?
A poolable yarn is one that can be used for a technique called "Color Pooling". Color pooling is the practice of stitching multi-colored yarn in such a way as to produce a pattern of colors, be it stripes, argyle, etc.

A yarn is considered poolable if it has a repeating color pattern where both the sequence of colors and the lengths of colored sections are consistent.
